I wrote code to send email invites for my wedding. I wrote a personal note to everyone in the email (I didn't want to write the infamous 'Please consider this as my personal invitation') 

Just backing it up here.

I went to Facebook, got everyone's email and then created an excel sheet in Google Docs, and exported it to csv.

What you need to do
-------------------

* Add your csv file to people-prod.txt
* Add your mailgun credentials in mailgun.rb
* Once it is sent, copy the sent ones to another file (people-done.txt in my case)
